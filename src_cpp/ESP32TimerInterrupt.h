  The ESP32 has two timer groups, each one with two general purpose hardware timers. All the timers are based on 64 bits
  counters and 16 bit prescalers. The timer counters can be configured to count up or down and support automatic reload
  and software reload. They can also generate alarms when they reach a specific value, defined by the software. The value
  of the counter can be read by the software program.

  Now even you use all these new 16 ISR-based timers,with their maximum interval practically unlimited (limited only by
  unsigned long miliseconds), you just consume only one ESP32 timer and avoid conflicting with other cores' tasks.
  The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
  Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
  This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

  Based on SimpleTimer - A timer library for Arduino.
